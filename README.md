# Neurology Clinic Templates

This project provides standardized anamnesis (patient history) templates for common complaints in neurology practice. Its purpose is to make the patient assessment and documentation processes more efficient, complete, and systematic for clinicians (neurologists, resident physicians, medical students).

## Project Structure

For each neurological complaint, there are two types of files:

1.  **`.txt` Template File:** A clean anamnesis template ready to be copied and pasted directly into patient notes or Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems.
2.  **`_Açıklama.md` Explanation File:** A detailed guide explaining the clinical reasoning behind each question, examination finding, and planning step in the template, its importance in differential diagnosis, and potential "red flags".

### Available Templates

*   **Headache:** `BaşAğrısı.txt` & `BaşAğrısı_Açıklama.md`
*   **Dizziness:** `BaşDönmesi.txt` & `BaşDönmesi_Açıklama.md`
*   **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH):** `BIH.txt` & `BIH_Açıklama.md`
*   **Dementia / Forgetfulness:** `Demans.txt` & `Demans_Açıklama.md`

## How to Use

*   **In Clinical Practice:** You can take a quick and complete history by copying the content of the relevant `.txt` file and pasting it into your patient record system.
*   **For Educational Purposes:** By reading the corresponding `_Açıklama.md` file, you can learn why certain questions are asked when evaluating a symptom, which findings point to which diagnoses, and current diagnostic criteria (e.g., SNOOP, HINTS, Modified Dandy).

## Key Features

*   **Standardization:** Ensures that critical questions are not missed for any patient.
*   **Efficiency:** Speeds up the documentation process in a busy outpatient clinic setting.
*   **Educational:** The explanation files describe the thought process from symptom to diagnosis step-by-step.
*   **Current and Evidence-Based:** The templates include internationally accepted and current diagnostic tools and criteria such as SNOOP (headache), HINTS (dizziness), and Modified Dandy (IIH).
*   **Turkish and Adapted for Local Practice:** Prepared entirely in Turkish, considering the needs of healthcare professionals in Turkey.
